Course page click [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/).

When I study this course, the new version(2020) has published, so the solutions to the homework are mixed.(A1 A2 for 2019 A3-6 for 2020)

The new version adds some new content and move major code from jupter to the .py file, which makes it more convenient to refer to previous code.The new version can be regarded as backward compatible, so the 2019(video public) also can refer to this solutions.
